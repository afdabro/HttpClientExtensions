#Security

Cloud security is a broad term that is often misrepresented. 
Yes, your data is in the cloud. A hacker *might* find it harder to retrieve your data simply because it is stored offsite. 
But cloud services still fall victim to the same low hanging fruit issues. Security is everyoneâ€™s responsibility. 
The [security development lifecycle (SDL)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sdl/) should be coordinated within an [Agile development life cycle](http://www.ambysoft.com/essays/agileLifecycle.html). Design for Security. Build threat models. 
Always put yourself in a security mindset; "If I was a hacker, how would I infiltrate this system?" 
Most all, familiarize yourself with known web vulnerabilities within your chosen technology stack. 
[OWASP top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page) is a good "general" starting point. 
Security information for Cloud N-tier and Micro-Service architectures are a little lacking.


##Crash Dumps

A cloud service could fail and generate a crash dump which is normally sent to a blob file storage. Securing passwords, tokens, etc. in memory is still *extremely* important. A hacker could (in-theory) gain access to the crush dump storage.
I have been on a few secure code reviews where a service's password is stored as a string. 
Use [`SecureString`](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/fpintos/archive/2009/06/12/how-to-properly-convert-securestring-to-string.aspx) to store any sensitive configuration settings in memory.
Within your application's trust boundary, always try to pass a `SecureString` to constructors or as a parameter. Eventually, you might be forced to call a third-party api which only accepts a string but at least your application is slightly more secure.

##Security Tokens

At some point, your service will need to store a token ([JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/introduction/), [Shared Access Signature Token](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1/), etc.) to authenticate with another service. This token will eventually expire and might contain claims. 
Having a class with a single responsibility of retrieving information about a token would be handy.
The [Windows Identity Foundation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh377151.aspx) in the .NET 4.5 framework supports a base class of [`SecurityToken`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.identitymodel.tokens.securitytoken(v=vs.110).aspx) for this purpose. Although there are several implementations available, I have created a few of my own for working with Azure and Auth0.
